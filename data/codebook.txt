Stations_density_2021.csv
Description
A dataset containing stations directly from CDOT (chicago department of transportation) with the corresponding latitude (lat), longitude (long), community area, and the number of stations within a 2 mile radius. This is going off of the dataset our mentor Amanda gave us, so the stations list is the most recently updated list available (year 2021).

Usage
Stations_density_2021.csv is stored under the dataframe stations_density_2021 in my R script.

Format
A data frame with 840 rows and 5 columns

Variables
station_name: the name of the station
in_2_mi_radius: the amount of stations within a 2 mile radius. For example, 40 means that there are 40 divvy stations located within a 2 mile radius of the corresponding station.
lat: latitude of the station location
lon: longitude of the station location
community_area: community area the station is located in

comm_density_2021.csv
Description
A dataset containing community areas, and the average number of stations within a 2 mile radius for each community area. This is going off of the dataset our mentor Amanda gave us, so the stations list is the most recently updated list available (year 2021).

Usage
comm_density_2021.csv is stored under the dataframe comm_density_2021 in my R script.

Format
A data frame with 70 rows and 2 columns

Variables
community_area: community area within Chicago
avg_in_2_mi_radius: the average amount of stations within a 2 mile radius, rounded to the hundredths. For example, 60.33 means that there are, on average, 60.33 stations within a 2 mile radius for the stations within the corresponding community area.
